## Document Object Model 

While completing the task, I came across real cases of working with elements of DOM elements, without using other libraries.
It was a good experience and I am very grateful to mentors for their help and review.

This was good OOP practice.
It wasn't easy to get it right the first time, but nevertheless it worked out and it was cool.

## OOP exercise

I tried to do the task perfectly the first time, but it turned out to be more difficult than it seemed.
Very good OOP practice, creating classes and constructors.
Thanks for help to the mentor and community members.

## Memory – Pair Game 

I was very involved in the execution of this task. A well is pumped to work with DOM methods and arrays.
I wanted to make the game beautiful, and as a result, some of my friends, whom I threw off the link to the task, admitted that they were stuck in the game for a long time =)

## Memory – Pair Game (in process)

This is a very interesting task that is very close to a real task.
To make the result sufficient for me, I asked my girlfriend to make me a layout in Figma.
Practiced array methods very well and learned how to best implement search.
Thank you for your patience to mentors who try to explain in as much detail as possible how to improve my work.
